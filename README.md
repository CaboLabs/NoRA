# NoRA

## No-code automation app for interacting with openEHR servers.

NoRA is a simple tool for interacting with openEHR servers and load custom data based on workflows defined by you. Just point and click, no code is required!

* Create different workflows to interact with openEHR servers
* Execute workflow definitions in real time
* Flexible configuration for server authentication
* Save, manage and share your workflow definitions

NoRA is a perfect app to learn about the openEHR REST API. Load specific data in your openEHR server for testing, verification and quality assurance. The advantage is that NoRA doesn't require any programming. Workflows are defined by very intuitive point-and-click interactions, and can executed immediately.
